## Reflection

either in person, on the phone, or on a video chat. Think of someone in your life who interacts 
with data to make better decisions. This might be a family member who runs a small business, a friend who runs a 
committee for the Parent Teacher Association, or a neighbor who teaches piano lessons. All of these people turn to 
data in some way to be more effective in their roles.
You can let them know you're training to be a data analyst, and are hoping to have a "data conversation" with them to practice your asking skills.
Hopefully, you'll end up with some useful recommendations that will benefit you both.
